# AngularApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.
Goal of this project is to develop a component (issue) which can be pluggable in any Angular component developed.

## Component - Issue

Issue component helps in reading a csv file and display the results in table. The table has additional features like sorting, search, pagination, etc.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
